## The linear path: Statistics & Bioinformatics

Bioinformatics: Data Science for biology

## However...

Towards the end of my PhD, I started:

--

- Dreaming of a life where I wasn't working on weekends

--

- Feeling the Data Science FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out).

## When my path deviated from (academic) linearity


👩‍💻 At the end of 2019 I joined the AI consulting company Melbourne based [Eliiza](https://eliiza.com.au/) and postponed my postdoc start

🐍  **Python on the job**



🤖 **Exposure to machine learning** in action & in production


💻  **Work as a team**: I was never only by myself on a project - we needed to deliver a solution as a team, usually Data Scientist + ML Engineer

## What I actually do every day 


🏡💻 **Work in a fun team**: Work with a fun interdisciplinary team of scientists, developers, marketing savvy.

📙 **Back to learning science**: Learn the intricacies of **mass spectrometry** (= most used technique to quantify proteins in a sample) & what life scientists need to make the best use of their experiment.

--

👩‍💻 **Develop in R & Python**: Assemble workflows in R to analyse mass spectrometry data.

--

👐 **Open Science**: Strive for reproducibility and open sourcing in what we produce.

## Summary: What I’ve learnt and what I would do differently

--

- Changing helped me became way more self-aware of what I actually enjoy

--

- I wouldn’t stress so much as I did in my last year of PhD about making the PERFECT decision for my future career

--

- I learnt to respect my free time way more and I’m so glad to be surrounded by people that share and respect this as well. 

--

- Talking and interacting with people was super valuable to find opportunities
  - I started working at Eliiza after interacting with speakers at the R-Ladies Melbourne events


---

## I found a happy place in a non linear path

Being a spline turned out to be a good fit for me.
